# Crime in Kansas City

In my Big Data Architecture class we utilized Hadoop and Hive to upload the data ourselves to HDFS and query it with Hive to come up with conclusions about our data

This is a dataset from [Opendata KC](https://data.kcmo.org/). It's a combination of their 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 datasets on Crime in Kansas City

I decided to also visualize some of the results within Tableau to highlight my conclusions.

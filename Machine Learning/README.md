# Biking in Chicago

In my Machine Learning class we talked about many different Machine Learning algorithms and how to implement them in Python with sklearn.

This is a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yingwurenjian/chicago-divvy-bicycle-sharing-data) that is a combination of data from bike-sharing company Divvy along with weather / temperature of the days the bikers rode.

I feature-engineered many new features and attempted to use OneHotEncoding along with standard scalar to help with the accuracy of my techniques.

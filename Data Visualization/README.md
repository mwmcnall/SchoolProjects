# Names

This was a project based on information from a [Google Bigquery dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/social-security-administration/us-names?filter=solution-type:dataset&q=public%20data%20names&id=7a385178-115c-44b0-8ec2-4da800e47888) that contained the first names from Birth Certificates in the US

I dedicated a project to my findings from exploring this dataset and creating visualizations in Tableau.

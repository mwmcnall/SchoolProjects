# Data Analytics w/ Stack Overflow

With this project I used the [Google Bigquery](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/google-bigquery-public-datasets-now-include-stack-overflow-q-a) free dataset of posts from Stack Overflow to look for insights, create graphs, and utilize machine learning techniques

[This is a link to generate a Jupyter slideshow of this project](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mwmcnall/SchoolProjects/blob/master/Data%20Analytics/StackOverflowProject.slides.html#/)

### Jupyter slideshow controls
- Spacebar / Down for next slide
- Shift-Spacebar / Up for previous slide

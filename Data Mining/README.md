# Data Mining

In this class each student was given the same dataset based on [this study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778815304357) conducted in an Office Space. We were asked to use KNIME as the analytics tool for this class.

By utilizing these variables
- Temperature
- Humidity
- CO2
- HumidityRatio
- Time
- Occupancy (measured as 0 or 1)

The goal of this project was to figure out the most optimal solution for being able to predict if a room was occupied.
